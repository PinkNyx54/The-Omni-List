# Unsafe Sites (AVOID AT ALL COST)
## Untrusted Sites
- IGG Games / PCGamesTorrents / LoadGames / GamesTorrents - they doxxed mercs213 (owner of GoodOldDownloads), package their own DRM, crypto miners, as well as malware, and exploit you for ad revenue.
- SteamUnlocked / GOG Unlocked / ROMs Unlocked - slow downloads, malicious link redirects and uploads stolen from IGG Games and nosTEAM. Sites do not provide source information making troubleshooting impossible.
- Any site which has been stopped/not owned by their original owners. These include:
    - The Pirate Bay / TPB - Malware Risk. Skulled users and the uploader "dauphong" aren't safe either.
    - Any site pretending to be RARBG. This site has been decommissioned and other malicious alternatives, linked to TPB, have been popping up. Do not trust them.
    - Kickass Torrents - Malware Risk.

- Any site with a scene group name in the URL - SCENE GROUPS DON'T HAVE SITES! (Examples such as CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, HOODLUM, RELOADED, SiMPLEX, DARKSiDERS, PLAZA, etc. They do not have sites. Sites with combination of these names aren't safe either.)
- Any site you find on Google by searching for "free game downloads", "cracked games", etc. Google de-lists piracy websites from its search results, which means that fake and malware-spreading sites will float to the top of the search results. This also applies to searches on YouTube aswell.
